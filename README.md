AVL Tree - self balancing binary search tree 
This project was programmed as part of my university studies (Data Structure course) at Tel Aviv University. 
The project aims to implement an AVL tree to comply with the AVL Tree rules. 
The program uses different functions such as insert, delete, join and split.
